The code has been tested in the remote and the implementation of COW is working fine. 


TEST OUTPUT:

----- Test case 1 -----
[prnt] - before fork - free-frames 56772
[prnt] - frames consumed when COW enabled should be less than when COW is disabled - free-frames 56704
[chld] - frames consumed when COW enbled should be less than when COW is disabled - free-frames 56704
[prnt] - after wait - free frames change to orignial number - free-frames 56772

----- Test case 2 -----
[prnt] - before fork - free-frames 56772
[prnt] - free-frames 56704
[chld] - free-frames 56704
[chld] - acess global_v1 without modify - global_var = 0 - free frames should remain unchanged - free-frames 56704
[prnt] - after wait - free frames change to orignial number - free-frames 56772

----- Test case 3 -----
[prnt] - before fork - free-frames 56772
[prnt] - free-frames 56704
[prnt] - acess global_v1 without modify - global_var = 0 - free frames should remain unchanged - free-frames 56704
[chld] - free-frames 56704
[chld] - acess global_v1 and modify - global_var = 100 - free frames should decrease by 1 free-frames 56703
[prnt] - after wait - free frames change to orignial number - free-frames 56772

----- Test case 4 -----
[prnt] - before fork - free-frames 56772
[prnt] - free-frames 56704
[prnt] - modified one element in the 1st page - global_array[0 = 111 - free frames should decrease by 1 - free-frames 56703
[chld] - free-frames 56703
[chld] - modified two elements in the 1st and the 2nd page - global_array[0] = 222 - free frames should furhter decrease by 1 - free-frames 56702
[prnt] - after wait - free frames change to orignial number - free-frames 56772
